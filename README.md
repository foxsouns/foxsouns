### Sup. Welcome to the dumb page.

My name is Sage. I know minimal bash, minimal ruby, very minimal batch, and a small chunk of html.
  - I'm (not really, but thinking about) working on [an interpreter for the Esolang "Hanoi Love"](https://github.com/foxsouns/HanoiL-Intp-Ruby), in ruby.
  - I am learning ruby, for said esolang.
  - It seems like I contribute to [willeccles' cpm](https://github.com/willeccles/cpm) fairly often. Give it a look!
  - She/her pronouns.

If I dont specify, you may assume my normal code and programs are GNU GPL, version 3 only; and you may assume images and other creative work of mine are CC BY-SA 4.0.
